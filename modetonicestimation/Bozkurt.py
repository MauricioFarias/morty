    This is an implementation of the method proposed for tonic and makam
    estimation, in the following sources. This also includes some improvements
    to the method, such as the option of PCD along with PD, or the option of
    smoothing along with fine-grained pitch distributions. There is also the

    option to get the first chunk of the input recording of desired length
    and only consider that portion for both estimation and training.

    the mode models. Then, the unknown mode and/or tonic of an input
    recording is estimated by comparing it to these models.
